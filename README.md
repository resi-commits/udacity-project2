## Project Description

The project displays a Landing Page which Navigation bar is dynamically generated. 
By selecting one navigation item, it is scrolled to the selected section of the page.
At the bottom of the page you will find a "scroll to top" button.

The basic project was forked from the udacity/fend Github repository and then customized.

## How to run this project
This project contains the following files that are needed to run the project:
* `index.html`: basic html file including header (without the navigation bar, because it gets dynamically generated), main (including all sections), button (to scroll to the top) and a footer.
* `styles.css`: style file that contains all relevant styling for the document, e.g. the navigation bar styling
* `app.js`: contains all the functionality of the landing page, e.g. when clicking on a section in the nav bar, scrolling to the correct section

Start a server connection to be able to have a look in the browser (localhost:port) or review it locally in your code editor preview section.
